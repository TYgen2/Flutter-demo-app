# Gallery App (Flutter, Firebase)
- Built with a user login function (email & password, anonymously)
- Add to favourites
- Search by name or artist name
- Light / Dark mode
- Random art

Currently learning **React Native**. Trying to built the same app with some improvements.
- Cleaner drawer content
- Better data flowing
- Using Firebase storage to store the Arts, instead of storing locally in Flutter

## Screenshots from app
### *I do not own any of the arts. This app is just for learning purpose.*
